  <h2 class="bold xs-mb2">What is Solid?</h2>

  <p class="xs-mb2">Solid is BuzzFeed's CSS style guide. Influenced by frameworks like <a href="http://www.basscss.com/">Basscss</a>, Solid uses immutable, atomic CSS classes to rapidly prototype and develop features, providing consistent styling options along with the flexibility to create new layouts and designs without the need to write additional CSS. Additionally, a few globally-resuable HTML and CSS components are available to help new apps spin up quickly without having to reinvent the wheel each time (with more on the way).</p>

  <p>You can read more about Solid in our <a href="#">blog post on Medium</a>.</p>
